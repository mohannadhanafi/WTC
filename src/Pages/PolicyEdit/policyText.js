We recognize that incidents do occasionally occur, and these are handled on a case by case basis to ensure partners know exactly what we expect of them. We know this will lead to a sustainable business for both our partners and us.</p><p>If an incident occurs during one of our rides, the Framework Cooperation and Transportation Services Agreement reserve the right for us to adjust the remuneration payable to our partners. Among others, the adjustments may cover customer retention vouchers and handling effort. In the case of recurring or severe incidents, a temporary offline setting or a termination of the contract may apply.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center; width: 40.8541%;">Incident Type</th><th style="text-align: center; width: 14.0854%;">Handling Fee 8.50 EUR</th><th style="text-align: center; width: 14.4561%;">Payment for the Ride</th><th style="text-align: center; width: 30.5882%;">Maximum Compensation for Cost Coverage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">WTC payment model not followed, e.g. asking for cash or accepting cash without explaining tip policy</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">100% of passenger price if full payment for the ride was taken</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Wrong driver sent 3 or wrong ride review</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">Correction of wrong review</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Misconduct, e.g. inappropriate or rude behavior</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">50% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Safety issue, e.g. missing baby seat or risky driving style</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">50% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Unauthorized subcontracting of ride 6</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">50% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">WTC standards not met, e.g. wrong dress code; no English; insufficient knowledge of area; no/wrong pickup sign; not helping with luggage</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">50% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Issue with vehicle, e.g. dirty or wrong vehicle sent</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">100% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Giving back a ride</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">Difference from final driver price to previous driver price</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">No ride confirmation 60 min ahead, not reachable causing backup booking</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">Cost for the backup booking 4</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">Driver is late for pickup or no meet &amp;amp; greet</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">100% of driver price 5</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40.8541%;">No pickup</td><td style="width: 14.0854%;"><br></td><td style="width: 14.4561%;"><br></td><td style="width: 30.5882%;">100% of driver price 5</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><ul><li>Handling Fee is charged to account for WTC amount of effort and time required to resolve the issue Resulting from the incident.</li><li>In case the driver received the payment for the ride from the passenger, we will adjust the emuneration payable to the partner in the next invoice.</li><li>If driver was not specified in the system or agreed with WTC.
